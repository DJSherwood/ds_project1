# Investigation of Crash Counts
The crash count dataset can be obtained from here: 
https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents

and the population information per county can be accessed here: 
https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/

I used pandas to transform, plotnine to visualize, umap to embed, hdbscan to cluster,and pycausaulimpact to analyze. 

Enjoy!
